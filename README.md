##  How It Works

```ts
// 1. Listen to Python execution
vscode.workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument((document) => {
  if (document.languageId === 'python') {
    runPythonCode(document); // Executes and processes output
  }
});

// 2. Show inline result
function showInlineOutput(line: number, output: string) {
  const decoration = createInlineTextDecoration(output);
  editor.setDecorations(decorationType, [decoration]);
}
```
